Self-Hosted renovate server to automate renovate actions

## Support Matrix

- Job Types
  - Cron Job
  - Webhook Events
    - `issue` with dashboard title: edited/closed/reopened
    - `pull/merge request` with checkbox edited/closed/reopened
    - `push`
- Platforms
  - `gitlab`
  - `github`
- Executors
  - `kubernetes` (creates kubernetes jobs to execute renovate)

## Usage

1. Create a `renovate` config in your repository, you can use [shareable config presets](https://docs.renovatebot.com/config-presets/) to save your time
   - see [`arhat-dev/renovate-presets`](https://github.com/arhat-dev/renovate-presets) for example

2. Deploy `renovate-server` to your local/cloud environment, then you will get a webhook endpoint exposed via your ingress controller
   - for kubernetes, you can customize your installation with [helm chart](./cicd/deploy/charts/renovate-server)

3. Configure your repository or organization, create a webhook for `renovate-server` with desired events, say `issues`, `pull requests` and `push`

4. Now you are good to go, every time you trigger the webhook with desired event payload, `renovate-server` will execute renovate for you
